# Hi there! 👋

I'm Reza🦈, an experienced web developer with over 8 years of expertise encompassing both back-end and front-end technologies. Proficient in PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, REST APIs, HTML, and CSS, I bring a comprehensive skill set to the table. Additionally, I have a keen eye for design and am proficient with tools like Figma and Photoshop. My experience extends to WordPress development, including the creation of custom themes and plugins from scratch. I am also well-versed in newer tech stacks such as React, GCP, AWS, Firebase, Sanity, and headless CMSs. Through my demonstrated history of working through all phases of web development, I have acquired skills in areas like a11y, SEO, optimization & performance and browser compatibility. My skills not limited here and have hands on experience in Android native app development too!

I'm open to any kind of related ideas, so let me know if you have anything in mind.
